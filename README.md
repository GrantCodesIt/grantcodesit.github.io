Grant Helm Zelenay's Portfolio Website

This website showcases the skills and projects I have learned through my coding career. 
It uses HTML/CSS and Javascript currently. In the future, the plan is to add nodeJs to showcase my full stack abilities. 
Other future plans are to include more coding projects and individual pages to showcase these objects while I learn more about web development.
